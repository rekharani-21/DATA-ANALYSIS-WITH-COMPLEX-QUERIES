##In this task, the goal was to practice advanced SQL querying by performing operations such as subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), grouping, and ranking student performance across different courses. The focus was on using MySQL Workbench to manage and query a database named college, which includes three main tables: students, courses, and results. Below is a detailed explanation of the entire process, including the structure of the database, the logic behind the queries, and how compatibility issues with MySQLâ€™s window functions were handled effectively. This task strengthened my understanding of SQL concepts including subqueries, CTEs, JOIN operations, aggregation, and simulated ranking. While RANK() was initially intended for ranking students, I successfully adapted to MySQL's limitations by using alternative logic. The results were verified and tested using MySQL Workbench and returned correct outputs, such as the top scorer per course and average scores.

Through this task, I improved not only my SQL skills but also my ability to solve problems using workarounds when certain database features are not available. This experience will help in handling real-world data problems where constraints are common.
